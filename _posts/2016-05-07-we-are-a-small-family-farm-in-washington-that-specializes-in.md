We are a small family farm in Washington that specializes in Icelandic sheep and their products. The sheep and the family like living in Western Washington at 1000'.

We have some of the best Icelandic bloodlines both from Iceland (through A.I.) and from within the US. A large proportion of our original breeding stock was from Tongue River Farm, where Susan Mongold worked tirelessly for many years to establish and develop the Icelandic breed in the US.

Sheep, fleece, roving, hand spun yarn and hand crafted items are all available for purchase. Please review our site and email or call Sue.
